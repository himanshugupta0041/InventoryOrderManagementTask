# Inventory & Order Management System

## Overview

Inventory & Order Management System is a production-style full-stack application for managing products, customers, orders, stock levels, and operational dashboard metrics.

The project is built as a clean modular monolith with a FastAPI backend, React frontend, PostgreSQL database, and Docker Compose orchestration. It is designed for a software engineering assessment and emphasizes correctness, maintainability, validation, transaction safety, and deployment readiness.

## Features

- Product management
  - Create, list, view, update, and soft-delete products.
  - Enforce globally unique SKUs.
  - Validate non-negative price and stock.
  - Generate deterministic name-based SKU suggestions.
  - Check SKU availability before product creation or update.

- Customer management
  - Create, list, view, update, and soft-delete customers.
  - Enforce unique customer email addresses.
  - Validate and normalize phone numbers to E.164 format.
  - Preserve order history when customers are deactivated.

- Order management
  - Create orders for existing customers and products.
  - Add one or more products per order.
  - Prevent duplicate products in the same order.
  - Calculate totals on the backend using current database prices.
  - Reduce stock transactionally when an order is placed.
  - Cancel orders and restore stock.
  - Prevent insufficient-stock orders.

- Dashboard
  - Total products.
  - Total customers.
  - Total orders.
  - Low-stock products based on configurable threshold.

- Platform
  - FastAPI validation and centralized error responses.
  - Structured request logging with request IDs.
  - Health, readiness, and metrics endpoints.
  - PostgreSQL migrations with Alembic.
  - Backend and frontend test suites.
  - Full Docker Compose stack.

## Notable Assessment Enhancements

These features go beyond the minimum CRUD flow while staying scoped to a clean modular monolith.

| Enhancement | What It Adds | Implementation Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Smart SKU Suggestion System | Suggests readable, available SKUs from a product name. | Rule-based and deterministic, not AI-based. Backend generates and validates suggestions; frontend shows the first two suggestions and still allows manual SKUs. Product creation and update continue to enforce uniqueness in the backend and database. |
| SKU Availability Checks | Warns users before submitting duplicate SKUs. | Supports edit mode with `exclude_product_id`, so the current product's SKU is not incorrectly marked as taken. |
| Country-Aware Phone Input | Users select a country/region code, then enter the national phone number. | Frontend uses `libphonenumber-js`; backend uses `phonenumbers`. Stored values are normalized to E.164 strings. No fixed 10-digit rule and no phone-number uniqueness constraint. |
| Customer and Product Detail Views | Users can open individual records from list pages. | Supports required `GET /products/{id}` and `GET /customers/{id}` flows from the UI. |
| Duplicate Order Item Protection | Prevents selecting the same product multiple times in one order. | Frontend disables already-selected products in other rows; backend rejects duplicate product IDs as validation safety. |
| Transactional Inventory Logic | Keeps stock and order records consistent. | Failed order creation rolls back completely; successful order creation reduces stock; cancellation restores stock. |
| Deployment Hardening | Production-ready Render/Vercel/Docker setup. | Includes Render PostgreSQL, Render backend, Vercel frontend, Docker Compose, Docker Hub image, health checks, CORS configuration, and README deployment docs. |

## Architecture

The backend uses a clean modular monolith. Route handlers stay thin, services own business rules, repositories own database access, and SQLAlchemy models define persistence.

## Design Patterns

| Pattern | Where Used | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Repository Pattern | Product, customer, order, dashboard repositories | Keeps SQLAlchemy queries out of route handlers and services. |
| Service Layer Pattern | Product, customer, order, inventory, dashboard services | Centralizes business rules and makes behavior easier to test. |
| Unit of Work / Transaction Pattern | Order creation and cancellation | Ensures stock updates, order creation, and order item creation succeed or fail together. |
| Builder Pattern | Backend test builders | Keeps tests readable and avoids repetitive fixture setup. |
| Factory-style Setup | App creation, settings, database session creation | Keeps application bootstrapping consistent and testable. |
| Strategy-ready Boundaries | Inventory and pricing logic | Allows future discount/pricing strategies without changing route handlers. |

## Business Rules

### Products

- SKU must be globally unique.
- SKU remains unique even after soft delete.
- Price cannot be negative.
- Quantity in stock cannot be negative.
- Missing products return `404`.
- Duplicate SKUs return `409`.
- Validation errors return `422`.
- Products are soft-deleted with `is_active = false`.

### Customers

- Email must be unique.
- Email must be valid.
- Phone numbers are stored as strings in E.164 format.
- Phone numbers are not unique.
- Customer deletion uses soft delete to preserve order history.
- Missing customers return `404`.
- Duplicate emails return `409`.
- Validation errors return `422`.

### Orders and Inventory

- Customer must exist before an order can be placed.
- Every product in an order must exist.
- Order items cannot be empty.
- Quantity ordered must be greater than zero.
- Duplicate product IDs in the same order are rejected.
- Orders cannot be placed if stock is insufficient.
- Creating an order reduces product stock.
- Cancelling an order restores stock.
- Total amount is calculated by the backend from database prices.
- Order creation is transactional.
- Failed order creation does not reduce stock or create a partial order.
- Order statuses are `PLACED` and `CANCELLED`.

## Environment Variables

Create a local `.env` file using the following template. Never commit real secrets.

```env
POSTGRES_USER=inventory_user
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=change_me
POSTGRES_DB=inventory_db
POSTGRES_HOST=postgres
POSTGRES_PORT=5432

DATABASE_URL=postgresql+psycopg2://inventory_user:change_me@postgres:5432/inventory_db

BACKEND_PORT=8000
FRONTEND_PORT=3000

CORS_ALLOW_ORIGINS=http://localhost:3000,http://localhost:5173
LOG_LEVEL=INFO
LOW_STOCK_THRESHOLD=5

VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000/api/v1
VITE_DEFAULT_COUNTRY=IN
```

### Production Backend Variables

```env
DATABASE_URL=postgresql+psycopg2://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/DB_NAME
CORS_ALLOW_ORIGINS=https://your-frontend-domain.vercel.app
LOG_LEVEL=INFO
LOW_STOCK_THRESHOLD=5
```

### Production Frontend Variables

```env
VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://your-backend-domain.com/api/v1
VITE_DEFAULT_COUNTRY=IN
```

Vite variables are baked into the static frontend build. If `VITE_API_BASE_URL` changes, rebuild and redeploy the frontend.

## Local Setup

### Backend

```bash
cd backend
python -m venv .venv
```

Activate the virtual environment for your operating system:

| Operating system / shell | Command |
| --- | --- |
| macOS / Linux | `source .venv/bin/activate` |
| Windows PowerShell | `.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1` |
| Windows Command Prompt | `.venv\Scripts\activate.bat` |

If PowerShell blocks script execution, allow it for the current terminal session only:

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

Then install dependencies, run migrations, and start the API:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
alembic upgrade head
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

Backend URLs:

- API docs: `http://localhost:8000/docs`
- Health: `http://localhost:8000/health`
- Readiness: `http://localhost:8000/ready`

### Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Frontend dev URL:

```text
http://localhost:5173
```

## Docker Setup

The Docker Compose stack runs:

- `postgres`: PostgreSQL 16 with a named volume.
- `backend`: FastAPI backend with Alembic migrations at startup.
- `frontend`: Vite production build served by Nginx.

Start the full stack:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

Run in detached mode:

```bash
docker compose up --build -d
```

Inspect services:

```bash
docker compose ps
docker compose logs -f backend
docker compose logs -f frontend
```

Stop services:

```bash
docker compose down
```

Stop services and remove the database volume:

```bash
docker compose down -v
```

Docker URLs:

- Frontend: `http://localhost:3000`
- Backend API: `http://localhost:8000/api/v1`
- Swagger docs: `http://localhost:8000/docs`
- Health: `http://localhost:8000/health`
- Readiness: `http://localhost:8000/ready`

## Testing

Backend tests:

```bash
cd backend
pytest -q
```

Backend coverage:

```bash
cd backend
pytest --cov=app tests/
```

Frontend tests:

```bash
cd frontend
npm test
```

Frontend production build:

```bash
cd frontend
npm run build
```

## Logging and Monitoring

The backend includes structured console logging and request tracing.

Logs include:

- timestamp
- log level
- request ID
- method
- path
- status code
- duration

Request ID behavior:

- If the client sends `X-Request-ID`, the backend reuses it.
- Otherwise, the backend generates a request ID.

Monitoring endpoints:

| Endpoint | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `/health` | Confirms the application process is running. |
| `/ready` | Confirms the backend can connect to PostgreSQL. |
| `/metrics` | Exposes metrics suitable for Prometheus-style scraping. |

## Deployment Guide

### Backend Deployment

Recommended platforms:

- Render
- Railway
- Fly.io

The backend can be deployed from source or as a Docker image.
This repository includes a root `render.yaml` Blueprint for Render. It provisions:

- A Docker-based backend web service using `backend/Dockerfile`.
- A Render PostgreSQL database.
- `DATABASE_URL` wired from the Render database connection string.
- A `/health` health check.

Required production variables:

```env
DATABASE_URL=postgresql+psycopg2://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/DB_NAME
CORS_ALLOW_ORIGINS=https://your-frontend-domain.vercel.app
LOG_LEVEL=INFO
LOW_STOCK_THRESHOLD=5
```

Production start command:

```bash
alembic upgrade head && uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port ${PORT:-8000}
```

### Database Migrations

Run migrations locally:

```bash
cd backend
alembic upgrade head
```

Run migrations inside Docker:

```bash
docker compose exec backend alembic upgrade head
```

The backend Dockerfile already runs migrations before starting the API server.

### CORS Setup

Set `CORS_ALLOW_ORIGINS` to the deployed frontend domain:

```env
CORS_ALLOW_ORIGINS=https://your-frontend-domain.vercel.app
```

For multiple domains:

```env
CORS_ALLOW_ORIGINS=https://your-frontend-domain.vercel.app,https://your-netlify-domain.netlify.app
```

Do not use `*` for production unless the assessment explicitly allows it.


```

Docker Hub backend image:

[montu04/order_management_task/tags/backend/](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/montu04/order_management_task/tags/backend/)

### Frontend Deployment

Recommended platforms:

- Vercel
- Netlify

This repository includes `frontend/vercel.json` so React Router routes such as `/products/:id` and `/orders/:id` fall back to `index.html` on Vercel.

Build settings:

| Setting | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Root directory | `frontend` |
| Install command | `npm install` |
| Build command | `npm run build` |
| Publish directory | `dist` |

Set the frontend production variable:

```env
VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://your-backend-domain.com/api/v1
```

## Future Improvements

- Authentication and role-based authorization.
- Product categories, brands, and barcode support.
- Import/export workflows for products and customers.
- Pagination, sorting, and advanced filtering for large datasets.
- Audit logs for inventory and order changes.
- Email notifications for low stock and order events.
- Background jobs for reporting and scheduled inventory checks.
- Production observability with hosted logs, metrics, and alerts.
- End-to-end tests with Playwright or Cypress.
